There are no hard and fast rules to adhere these strictly as agile is adoption of process that makes sense and that's what made sense to us too. </p>\n<h2>Inception</h2>\n<p>Inception is a workshop that generally happens for about 5 days, where all the stakeholders of the project are available at one place and the project requirements are discussed together as a group and we come to a consensus as well as a group.\nThis is also a process where we identify responsibilities and assign it to each stakeholders, define and communicate the process that we would be following as part of the project, such as the agile ceremonies, showcases, acceptance methodologies etc. </p>\n<p>Generally the stake holders are people such as </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product Owners</li>\n<li>Business Owners</li>\n<li>Technical Team</li>\n<li>End Users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>to name a few</p>\n<p>The rest of the blog talks about what we do as part of this workshop. </p>\n<h3>1.

Identifying Project Goals - Is / Isn’t / Does/ Doesn’t</h3>\n<p><em>Session For: Product Owners, Business Owners, Technical Team, End Users</em></p>\n<h4>This session helps in</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Identification of Product/Project Goals</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What do we do</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Divide a white board into four areas: Is / Is not / Does / Does not.</li>\n<li>Write the name of the product above the quadrants.</li>\n<li>Ask each participant to describe the product by putting post-its onto the\ncorresponding areas.</li>\n<li>Read and group similar notes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./images/inception/projectGoals.png\" alt=\"Project Goals\"></p>\n<h3>4. Persona Workshop</h3>\n<p><em>Session For: Product Owner, Technical Team, End Users</em></p>\n<h4>This session helps in</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify different types of users </li>\n<li>Identify different system interactions </li>\n<li>Identify their needs and goals</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What do we do</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Based on the outcome of user research, we pick different types of users one at a time. </li>\n<li>Divide the existing people into smaller groups</li>\n<li>Each group to come up with a persona for the selected type of user/ system based on the template</li>\n<li>Each group to present it’s persona to the rest of the team </li>\n<li>Vote for features to identify a unified persona</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./images/inception/persona.png\" alt=\"Persona\"></p>\n<p>At the end of this exercise, we come up different users of the system and their demographic information.\nThis will help us build better use cases targeting the specific needs of the audience.</p>\n<h3>5. Feature Discovery: Persona - Goal Mapping</h3>\n<p><em>Session For: Product Owner, Business Owners,Technical Team and End Users</em></p>\n<h4>This session helps in</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify features</li>\n<li>Identify how the features helps the Persona’s reach their goals</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What do we do</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Put the product goals as column titles on the board. Prioritise these goals from left to right, high to low.</li>\n<li>Put the personas as row titles in priority order from top (high) to bottom (low).</li>\n<li>Everyone suggests features and places them on the table. Use the personas and goals to guide the discussion. The key question is “what does the product need to do so that this persona reaches this goal”.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./images/inception/goalMapping.png\" alt=\"GoalMapping\"></p>\n<h3>6. User and Data Journeys</h3>\n<p><em>Session For: Product Owners, Business Owners and Technical Team</em></p>\n<h4>This session helps in</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify User and Data Journeys</li>\n<li>How each steps the persona needs to do to achieve their goals</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What do we do</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Select a persona.</li>\n<li>Identify a goal for this persona.</li>\n<li>Write the persona and their goal on a post-it and place it on the top</li>\n<li>Decide the starting point write this starting point on a post-it and put it on the canvas.</li>\n<li>Describe each following step on a post-it and place it next on the canvas.
