We call this as an **Element**.\n\n### Layout\n\nThe layout consisted of a elements that can be stacked vertically, or horizontally.\nSo we needed containers that would let to stack the elements either vertically or horizontally.\nThese can be recursive letting horziontal and vertical be stacked inside each other as well as shown in the example below.\n\n![Layout example](./layout.png)\n\nTo achieve this we needed a _Recursive JSON configuration_.\n\n### Building the JSON configuration\n\nWe wanted to capture the following\n\n- A way to identify Horizontal/ Vertical / Element\n- Define widths of the Elements ( especially useful when horizontally stacked)\n- Identify the elements with an `id` so that it can be replaced with content ( more of this later in the blog )\n- Other configurations to appropriately paint the content inside an element.\n\nSo a sample JSON looked something like this.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"Element\",\n  \"config\": {\n    \"id\": \"e1\",\n    \"height\": \"200px\",\n    \"color\": \"yellow\",\n    \"width\": \"12\"\n  },\n  \"children\": []\n}\n```\n\n| Property | Description                                                               |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| type     | One of the values in Element, Vertical or Horizontal                      |\n| config   | Consists of a property `id` and other properties to help draw the element |\n| children | An array of child nodes, which follow the same format                     |\n\nTypically an `Element` will have an empty children and the others would have one or more items.\n\nYou can find a sample full blown JSON [here](./src/config/PageFormat.js)\n\n### Working with the JSON\n\nWe used Material-UI as part of the project, and leveraged it's Grid to help with drawing our layout.\n\nThe Material UI defines Grids using `<Grid \\>` tag. You can define a `<Grid container \\>` that would contain many `<Grid item \\>` which would have the content.\nThe `<Grid item \\>` can also take a parameter called `xs` which can be a number between 1- 12 as defined by it's 12 grid layout.\n\nTranslating this to our solution, we will\n\n- Have a Grid container for each of the `Vertical` items\n- No special handling for `Horizontal` and just let the children be created\n- `Elements` are rendered inside a Grid Item.\n\nIn the above case, both the `Elements` and `Vertical` are set with the width passed to it.\n\nSo we created a class called the [GridContainer](src/components/grid/GridContainer.js) that\ntakes an input config, which is nothing but a single element of the JSON, checks for it's type to be one in \"Vertical\", \"Horizontal\" or \"Element\" and\n\n- For Vertical\n  - It wraps inside a `<Grid item />`\n  - Iterates through all it's children and wraps them with a `<Grid container />` each\n  - Invokes the `GridContainer` again ( recursively ) with the child config value.\n- For Horizontal\n  - Iterates through the children and invokes the `GridContainer` for each of it's children.\n- For Elements\n  - Uses the config and draws the element.\n\nThe Key element of this class is how the config is used to build the layout in a recursive fashion.\n\n## Handling the Elements\n\nEach of the `Elements` in the grid can contain a different type of element.\nAs it was an executive dashboard, we needed a bunch of plots and their titles ( simplifying the problem for the blogs sake ).\n\nAs mentioned earlier, each of the `Elements` holds an `id` and we gave a separate mapping for each of these Ids, that consisted of\n\n- `type` which can be `title` or `plot`\n- `config` which is an object that consists of the values required for each of the types of elements.\n\nThis helped us to extend the number of types easily, by having a flexible config for each type of element.  \nThe [Element](./src/components/element/Element.js) checks for the type and delegates it's rendering to the corresponding type ( in this case a [Title](./src/components/element/Title.js) or a [Plot](./src/components/element/Plotly.js)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe overall configuration looked like [this](./src/config/PageFormat.js) that consisted of\n\n- Page Layout consisting of \\*`Horizontal`, `Vertical` and `Elements` that helped us draw the layout.\n  - The `Horizontal` and `Vertical` components would have `children` and the structure can be recursive.\n  - Each `Element` had an `id`\n- Viz Configuration consisting of\n  - Mapping for each of the `id` from the `Elements`\n  - Can be of different types, in this case `Title` and `Plot`\n\nIn the [Part 2](https://techmusings.dev/buildingAConfigDrivenUiInReactPart2) of this blog post, we'll see how we were able to build this configuration using Drag and Drop components and persist the same into a backend.\n","pagePath":"arunmadhavan-g/config-driven-ui"}}}}
