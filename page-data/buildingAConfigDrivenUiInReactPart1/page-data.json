We call this as an __Element__. \n\n\n### Layout\n    \nThe layout consisted of a bunch of elements that were stacked vertically, or horizontally. \nSo we needed to have containers that would let to stack the elements either vertically or horizontally. \nThere are also cases where we wanted to stack the Vertical / Horizontal containers inside each other or within themselves.\n\n![Layout example](./layout.png)\n\nIn the above example we have a vertical container that has elements E1 and E4 stacked vertically, along with a horizontal container H1.\nH1 in-turn stacks in the elements E2 and E3 horizontally. \n  \nTo achieve this we needed a recursive JSON configuration.\n  \n","pagePath":"arunmadhavan-g/config-driven-ui"}}}}
